## Word Embedding

Representing words with a list of features

Example:

Feature = [ gender, living, fruit]

Word Embedding of some words using above features

</br>

man = [ -1.02, +0.97, -0.86]

woman = [ +0.98, +1.03, -0.82]

orange = [ +0.04, -0.87, +0.92]

</br>

These embeddings are calculated using a small (2 layers) nn

### Word2Vec
