## What is Neural network

Example
size vs price prediction

> size ---> neuron ---> prize

But if there are many input parameters we can stack inputs together

> inputs ---> neuron ---> output

We can also put intermediate checkpoints to more precisely calculate the relation between each input,
which will help in generating more accurate output

### Example (Intuition)

Consider there are 2 inputs size and number of bedroom
size and number of bedroom

These two inputs can be use to predict how many people will stay in that house

Which will help us predict prize more accurately 

### Reality
These hidden neurons works similar to aur intuition but may not correspond to expected properties

Eg: size and bedroom may not predict family size but something else

Neural Network determines the most optimal property as we train the network 

********

## Supervised Learning
Trains on data in which outputs are label

### Structured Data

Well defined data

Example: size of house,number of bedroom etc

### Unstructured Data

Example: Image, Audio, Text


****

Performance of a neural network can be improved by

- Increasing the size of network
- Training on larger set of data
- Newer Algorithms

m = size of training set
